# Todo

- [ ] Create simple dataset with DeepMind math generator

- [ ] Create vocab for DeepMind dataset

- [ ] Create dataloader for dataset

- [ ] Create Transformer arch

- [ ] Create 7 head input

- [ ] Train until saturation, find way to measure limit

- [ ] Add two self-aware tokens

- [ ] Create a predictor dataset. Predict all test set. Mark if it's correct or not, and train model to predict correct or not. 

- [ ] Add previous wrong prediction, and step by step for current learning.

- [ ] Train until saturation, find way to measure limit

- [ ] Add logic to fulfill all 7 memory slots
