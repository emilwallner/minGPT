# Todo
- [ ] Restructure file format to add a status line in dataset files

- [ ] Implement new temp file logic

- [ ] Implement adaptive compute predicitons

- [ ] Make compute steps a hyper-parameter

- [ ] Debugging and integrate to main loop



# Done

- [x] Create simple dataset with DeepMind math generator

- [x] Create vocab for DeepMind dataset

- [x] Create dataloader for dataset

- [x] Create Transformer arch

- [x] Create 7 head input

- [x] Train until saturation, find way to measure limit

- [x] Add two self-aware tokens

- [x] Create a predictor dataset. Predict all test set. Mark if it's correct or not, and train model to predict correct or not. 

- [x] Add previous wrong prediction, and step by step for current learning.

- [x] Train until saturation, find way to measure limit
